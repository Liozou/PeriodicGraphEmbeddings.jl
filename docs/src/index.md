# PeriodicGraphEmbeddings

A Julia package for manipulating periodic graph embeddings in euclidean spaces, such as
those representing atoms in a crystal.

See also:

- [PeriodicGraphs.jl](https://github.com/Liozou/PeriodicGraphs.jl) for the all that
  relates to the periodic graph itself, irrespective of its euclidean embedding.
- [CrystalNets.jl](https://github.com/coudertlab/CrystalNets.jl) for a dependent package
  specialized on crystal nets.
